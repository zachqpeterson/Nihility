# Nihility

This is a 2D game engine made from scratch, I've made my own data structures, memory allocator, and math library. I try to get as low level as possible by making my own file stream and using Raw Input. This is still an ongoing project that I plan to make games in.

## Future Plans
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Multithreading
- [ ] Project Creation/Management System
- [ ] Basic Editor And Debug Tools

## Setup
- install the Vulkan SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home, leaving all setting default is sufficient
- Clone the repository
- Open the solution in Visual Studio and set the startup project to any of the demo projects

## Current 3rd party libraries
LunarG Vulkan SDK - https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/, Vulkan source, vma, spir-v, etc.

msdfgen - https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen, Font MSDF generation
